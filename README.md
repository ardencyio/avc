Install node packages using desired node package manager

### Running the project
```sh
# cd into root of project and run
pnpm install

# or

npm install

# or with yarn
yarn install

```

Then to run the project in development mode with hot reloading

```sh
pnpm run dev

# or `npm` or `yarn` instead of pnpm e.g.
npm run dev
```

### Contributing

Pull the latest `main` or `develop` branch. A good option is to use [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) to improve your workflow.

```sh
# cd into project root
cd <project_location>

# pull the latest version of master
git pull

# create a new branch
git branch <branch_name>
```
